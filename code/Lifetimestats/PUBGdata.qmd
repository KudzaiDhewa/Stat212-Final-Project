## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r setup}
#| include: false
knitr::opts_chunk$set(error=TRUE)

```

```{r}
library(httr) 
library(jsonlite) 
library(tidyverse)
library(purrr)

```

```{r}
player_ids <- read.csv("../course_project/players.csv")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
api_key <- "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJqdGkiOiJhOGVkYjBkMC03N2IxLTAxM2QtNjI3Mi0xNjVmNmJlZjNhYmMiLCJpc3MiOiJnYW1lbG9ja2VyIiwiaWF0IjoxNzMwMTU3ODUwLCJwdWIiOiJibHVlaG9sZSIsInRpdGxlIjoicHViZyIsImFwcCI6InN0YXRzcHJvamVjdCJ9.TGpk6uvZJH4x7A5MsrZuWKSBHw4mkoPp1nYcPqYjKEg"


```

###set system sleep for a while when pulling the data
###use the endpoint where you can pull data in groups of ten
## and know rate limit to do this.
####get lifetime stats for the first 10 000 players.

###use the function where i can pull for 10 players a time for each game mode. That way I can have for the same set of players 
## might take me 10 hours
### find a way to optimise this. Can you pause a pull request.

## ##Exploring teamwork through PUBG.

###explore number of wins people get when playing in a group compared to playing solo. Number of revives that they get.

### #looking at lifetime trends

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

####leaderboard on pc-na

##get a particular season and then pull names of players

##use function to get the lifetime stats on these players

##create a table and a visualization
